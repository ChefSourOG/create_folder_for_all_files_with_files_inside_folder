# Description of the Batch File
This batch file is designed to organize files in the same directory as the batch file itself. It creates a separate folder for each file (excluding the batch file) and moves the corresponding file into its respective folder. This helps in keeping the directory tidy and organized.
# How to Use the Batch File: Step-by-Step
1. Prepare Your Files: Place all the files you want to organize in the same directory as the batch file. Ensure that the batch file is named create_folder_for_all_files_with_files_inside_folder.bat.

2. Locate the Batch File: Open the folder where the batch file is located.

3. Run the Batch File: Simply double-click on the create_folder_for_all_files_with_files_inside_folder.bat file. This will execute the batch file.

4. Check for Folder Creation: The batch file will automatically check if the folder exists and will create a new folder for each file (excluding itself) in the same directory. It will display messages indicating which folders were created and which files were moved.
Review the Results: After the batch file has finished running, you will see new folders in the directory, each named after the corresponding file (without the file extension). The original files will be moved into their respective folders.

5. Close the Window: Once you have reviewed the results, you can close the command window that appears after running the batch file.

# Note
Ensure that there are no files with the same name (excluding the extension) in the directory, as this will cause conflicts when creating folders.
The batch file will not move itself; it only processes other files in the directory.
